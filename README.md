# Dashboard Truck Tracking (Mock)
This mini-project is a quick and practical exercise where I integrated a simple truck tracking interface (see screenshot below). The main goal was to connect a clean Vue.js front-end with an API mock generated using SwaggerHub.  
The idea behind this small app is to showcase how to set up HTTP requests, handle mock data, and structure a front-end project in a straightforward and efficient way.
